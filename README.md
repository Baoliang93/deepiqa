# Image Quality Assessment using Deep Learning (OU-DU-NRIQA)

Algorithm-based Image Quality Assessment outputs a quality score for a given (possibly distorted) input image to mimic the response of a human observer. Traditional IQA required a distortion-free version of the input image (full-reference), knowledge of types of possible distortions (distortion-aware) or training on subjective opinion scores (opinion-aware) and was based on hand-crafted features. This project proposes and validates the first ever method to overcome all of these limitations using learned features.
